<p>1. Get a checkup. If you are new to exercise or you have any health issues -- especially heart problems or conditions that affect your muscles or joints -- get a physical exam by your doctor or other health care provider before you start a muscle-building program.</p>
<p>2. Skip the shortcuts. As you are starting on your path to bigger muscles, focus on the basics, says Shawn Arent, PhD, a certified strength and conditioning specialist and associate professor at Rutgers University in New Jersey. Spend your energy working out and eating right -- not chasing fancy supplements. And do not even think about using steroids, he says. They can do serious damage to your body now and in the long run.You don't need steroids to build better muscles. During puberty, your body naturally pumps out testosterone. This hormone encourages your muscles to grow, says William Roberts, MD, a professor of family medicine and a youth fitness expert at the University of Minnesota.</p>

<p>3. Build a solid program. When you're starting out, avoid tossing together bits and pieces of different weight-lifting programs you see in magazines, Arent says. Instead, build a basic core program that includes the bench press (for your chest), squats (legs), deadlift (legs and back), and shoulder press (shoulders and upper back). As you master these, or you start playing a sport that requires specific strengths, you can add more complex lifts.</p>
<p>4. Get enough calories. Do your parents give you a hard time about eating so much? If you are training hard, politely ask them to give it a rest, says Roberta Anding, RD, a dietitian who works with athletes ranging from high schoolers to the Houston Astros and the Houston Texans. You need calories for growth and performance!</p>
<p>5. Feed your muscles when they are hungry. Another muscle-building hormone your body makes is insulin, Anding says. It makes your muscles soak up sugar, proteins, and other things that make them bigger and stronger.
Insulin is extra-effective right after a workout. So within 30 minutes after a workout, eat a blend of carbs and protein.</p>
